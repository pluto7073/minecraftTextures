This contains a folder of the Minecraft 1.16.2 Resources.
It includes the textures, blockstates, lang files, fonts, 
particles, texts, models, and shaders that are Minecraft's
defaults. I do not own any of these textures, But I thought
I would make this for anyone who wants to edit the default
Minecraft textures to create their own
